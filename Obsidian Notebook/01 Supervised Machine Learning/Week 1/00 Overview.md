- The [[03 Cost Function Formula]] is used to find the current difference from prediction to actual target for EACH input feature in the model
	- **NOTE:** You can also think of "Cost" as "Error"
	- Were trying to get as close to zero as possible
- If we do this for every value (within a range) for the inputs `w` and `b`, then we get a curve with a minimum.
	- Note that if we have both `w` and `b`, then this will be a 3D map
- Once we have this curve, we can minimize AKA find the minimum of the slope using [[04 Gradient Descent]]
- With Gradient Descent, we slowly make our way towards the minimum (or a minima) on the graph using a learning rate (alpha) TIMES  and a number of epochs.
