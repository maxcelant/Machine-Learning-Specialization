#### Supervised Learning
- Supervised Models learn from the 'right answers'
- **Regression** means to predict a number from infinitely many numbers
- **Classification** means that you are trying to predict which category/class a subject falls into.
	- Usually there are a limited amount of categories/classes
	- ex: Breast Cancer Detection
		- Think about what input values may be used to create an accurate prediction (size, thickness of tumor, age, etc)

#### Unsupervised Learning
- Find something interesting in **unlabeled** data by clustering into groups
- **Clustering** is a the idea of grouping together like data points
	- ex: Google News does this by clustering daily incoming news into categories
- **Anomaly Detection** is used to find unusual data points
- **Dimensionality Reduction** is used to compress data using fewer numbers
