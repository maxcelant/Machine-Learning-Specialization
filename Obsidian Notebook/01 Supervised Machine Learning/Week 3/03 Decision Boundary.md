- The decision boundary is the line where`w â€¢ x + b = 0`

- If the parameters `w = 1`, then you can simply compute using the `x`'s
**Non-linear decision Boundaries**

- Again, you make the `w` parameters = 1 and solve for the `x`'s
- When `x1^2 + x2^2 >= 1`, then predict `y_hat = 1`
- When `x1^2 + x2^2 < 1`, then predict `y_hat = 0`
- You can even go more extreme with higher order boundaries using polynomials
