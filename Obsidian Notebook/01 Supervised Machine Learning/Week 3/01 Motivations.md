- Linear regression is **not** a good algorithm for classification problems
- If there are only two possible outputs (like No and Yes), this is **Binary Classification**
- Class == Category
- We use conventions (false/true, 0/1)
- "true" is called the positive class, "false" is called the negative class
- negative means theres an **absence** of what were looking for
- positive means theres a **presence** of what were looking for
- **Logistic Regression** is used for classification problems
