- Getting more training data can help fix this
- Select features to include/exclude
	- Maybe use less polynomial features
- Lots of features with few training examples results in an inaccurate model / overfit 
	- **Feature Selection** - Use most relevant features

#### Regularization
- Reduce the size of parameters `w[j]`
- By making them smaller, we reduce the wavy-ness of the line
