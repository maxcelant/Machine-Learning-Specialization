- The **input layer** can combine (or not) to form another layer which then spits out more inputs until we get to the output
- It should be noted that every layer must have access to all neurons from the previous layer
- The output is also called **output layer**
- The layers in the middle are called the **hidden layers**

- Neural networks are kind of like a logistic regression model with the [[07 Feature Engineering]] we did, except it learns and does feature engineering it on its own!
- **Neural Network Architecture** is asking how many layers and how many neurons at each level
