- A 1000x1000 pixel image can be thought of a (1000x1000) matrix with rgb values in each cell
- Unpack that matrix into a single input vector with 1,000,000 rgb values
- Each layer of the model gets less abstract and more detailed
- Remember, neural networks find these layer patterns all on their own!
