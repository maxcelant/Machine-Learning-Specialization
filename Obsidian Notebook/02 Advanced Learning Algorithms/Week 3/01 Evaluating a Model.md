-  In order to test the accuracy of your model, you can separate your data set into two sets:
	- 70% - training set ![[Pasted image 20221119224530.png]]
	- 30% - test set ![[Pasted image 20221119224537.png]]
- if the cost or `J` of the test set is high, this means the model is not good at generalizing for new data
- In Logistic Regression problems, if yhat is not equal to y, then we can mark it. At the end, we can tally how many test examples were misclassified
