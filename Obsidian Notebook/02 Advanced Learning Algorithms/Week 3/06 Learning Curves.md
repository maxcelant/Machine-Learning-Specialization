- As the training data gets bigger, the error is reduced for the validation set
- However, error *increases* for the training set increases because the curve won't be able to perfectly cover all the points

#### High Bias
- The average training error plataues after awhile since the curve can't fit the data any better

- So...having more training data will NOT help if **High Bias / Underfitting** is the problem

#### High Variance
- The gap between the validation error and training error will be much greater
- In this case, more training data WILL help
