**Get more training examples**
- This will help fix a *high variance/overfitting* problem

**Try smaller sets of features**
- This will help fix a *high variance/overfitting* problem

**Try getting additional features**
- This will help fix a *high bias/underfitting* problem

**Try adding polynomial features (x^2, x^3)**
- This will help fix a *high bias/underfitting* problem

**Try decreasing λ**
- This will help fix a *high bias/underfitting* problem

**Try Increasing λ**
- This will help fix a *high variance/overfitting* problem

#### Takeaways...
If **high variance / overfitting** is your problem then add more training data or simplify your model by removing features or increasing regularization.

If **high bias / underfitting** is your problem then add polynomial features and add more features!
